# Control Flow Practice  

Welcome to the **Control Flow Practice** repository! üéâ  
This repository is designed to help you practice and strengthen your understanding of conditional statements (`if`, `else`, and `else-if` ladder) with hands-on coding problems.  

## Why Practice Control Flow? ü§î  
Theory alone isn't enough to master programming. Practical exercises allow you to:  
- Build a strong foundation for advanced concepts.  
- Develop problem-solving intuition.  
- Gain confidence in writing efficient and concise code.  

> **Tip**: Always attempt the problems on your own before checking the solutions. Resist the temptation to peek at the answers too soon! üí™

## Problems Covered üìù  

### **Problem 1: Find the Maximum of Three Numbers**  
Write a program to find the maximum among three numbers.  

**Input:**  
Input num1: 10  
Input num2: 20  
Input num3: 15  

**Output:**  
Maximum among all three numbers is 20.

- **Approach 1:** A detailed step-by-step method using conditional statements.  
- **Approach 2:** A concise and optimized solution.  

---

### **Problem 2: Character Classification**  
Write a program to classify an input character as:  
- Alphabet  
- Digit  
- Special Character  

**Input:**  
Input any character: 3  

**Output:**  
Character is Digit.

- **Approach 1:** Use basic conditions to identify character types.  
- **Approach 2:** Solve using ASCII values for a more technical approach.

### **Problem 3: Minimum Number of Notes for an Amount**  
Write a program to input an amount and print the minimum number of currency notes required (‚Çπ500, ‚Çπ100, ‚Çπ50, ‚Çπ20, ‚Çπ10, ‚Çπ5, ‚Çπ2, ‚Çπ1).  

**Input:**  
567890  

**Output:**  
500 = 1135  
100 = 3  
50 = 1  
20 = 2  
10 = 0  
5 = 0  
2 = 0  
1 = 0  

- **Approach:** Utilize a greedy algorithm to maximize the use of higher denomination notes.  

---

### **Problem 4: Triangle Type Checker**  
Write a program to determine whether a triangle is:  
- Equilateral  
- Isosceles  
- Scalene  

**Input:**  
Input first side: 30  
Input second side: 30  
Input third side: 30  

**Output:**  
Triangle is equilateral.

- **Approach:** Understand the properties of triangles and implement conditional checks.  

---

### **Problem 5: Electricity Bill Calculator**  
Write a program to calculate the total electricity bill based on the following rates:  
- First 50 units: ‚Çπ0.50/unit  
- Next 100 units: ‚Çπ0.75/unit  
- Next 100 units: ‚Çπ1.20/unit  
- Above 250 units: ‚Çπ1.50/unit  

**Additional Charge:**  
A surcharge of 20% is added to the total bill.  

**Input:**  
Enter electricity units: 275  

**Output:**  
Total Bill: ‚Çπ XYZ

- **Approach:** Follow the conditions step by step to calculate the total bill.
